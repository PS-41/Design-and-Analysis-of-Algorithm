# Brief description

### Overview
This project implements an optimal divide-and-conquer algorithm to compute Measure and Contour for a set of Iso-Rectangles, i.e. rectangles whose sides are aligned with the coordinate axes.

### Input and running
Build and run by using the command ```./run.sh <input_files>```  
The input must be ```.txt``` files and must represent a set of iso-rectangles.
Sample input has been included in ```input/```.
Execute ```./run.sh data/*``` to run the program on all sample files.  
Any metadata may be present in lines prepended by a # in the input files.  
All output will be generated in ```output/```.
